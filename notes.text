    =============TIPS FOR QUICK CREATION OF FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS AND CLASS COMPONENTS ====================
    IMPORTANT:
    (es7 react/redux/react-native/... snippets) extension must be installed in order to use the shortcuts below
    
    Inside the components folder create a new file with the name of the component you want to create

    * rcc + tab = class component
    * rfc + tab = functional component or 
    * rafce + tab = functional component with export
    * rce + tab = class component with export default at the end or
    * rfe + tab = functional component with export default at the end


    eg. rcc + tab = class component 
    import React, { Component } from 'react'

    export default class componentName extends Component {
        render() {
            return (
                <div>
                    
                </div>
            )
        }
    }
